# Codebase Subway Map (Cursor Skill)

Turn your codebase into a **subway map poster** with Cursor.

This agent skill generates an image prompt designed for **Cursor’s built-in Nano Banana Pro image generation integration**.

## Install in Cursor

1. Open **Cursor**
2. Click **Cursor** in the **top-left**
3. Go to **Settings**
4. Open **Cursor Settings**
5. In **Rules**, click **+ New**
6. Select **Add from GitHub**
7. Paste this repo URL into the top bar:

`https://github.com/edwin-cursor/codebase-subway-map.git`

## Use

You can trigger it either by asking:

- “Make a subway map of this codebase”
- “Visualize my project as a metro map”
- “Generate a Vignelli-style NYC poster version”

Or run it directly with the command:

`/subway-map`

The skill will ask you to pick a style (NYC / Madrid / DC / London / Surprise / Other) and then generate a .png. I'd love to see what you make, so please share it on twitter!

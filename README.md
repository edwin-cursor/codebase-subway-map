# Codebase Subway Map (Cursor Skill)

Turn your codebase into a **subway map poster** with Cursor.

This agent skill generates an image prompt designed for **Cursor’s built-in Nano Banana Pro image generation integration**.

## Install in Cursor

- Run this command: `/create-skill https://raw.githubusercontent.com/edwin-cursor/codebase-subway-map/refs/heads/main/SKILL.md`

## Use

You can trigger it either by asking:

- “Make a subway map of this codebase”
- “Visualize my project as a metro map”
- “Generate a Vignelli-style NYC poster version”

Or run it directly with the command:

`/subway-map`

The skill will ask you to pick a style (NYC / Madrid / DC / London / Surprise / Other) and then generate a .png. I'd love to see what you make, so please share it on twitter!
